/*
 * Wiring note — this is deliberately OSGi Declarative Services, not a Spring bean.
 *
 * Jahia's engineering conventions (the shared `cortex` harness, skill
 * `jahia-java-osgi-declarative-services`) state the rule as: DS is the ONLY dependency-injection
 * mechanism allowed in a Jahia module — Blueprint is deprecated and Spring is forbidden, with the sole
 * tolerated exception being a guarded `SpringContextSingleton.getBean(...)` read-through to a core bean.
 * An earlier revision of this filter was registered as a Spring bean in META-INF/spring; it was moved
 * here to follow that rule, and the render filter it registers behaves identically either way (both end
 * up in JahiaTemplateManagerService.getRenderFilters()).
 *
 * The same harness documents the trap to watch for if this is ever ported to another module: without the
 * bnd instruction `<_dsannotations>*</_dsannotations>`, an @Component class compiles and ships but emits
 * no OSGI-INF descriptor and no Service-Component header, so the component silently never registers and
 * the gate below simply does not run. Parents `jahia-modules` >= 8.1.7.0 switch it on already; older ones
 * do not. Verify a descriptor is actually in the built jar rather than assuming.

/**
 * Renders the roles component from the settings template that declares its access rule, and only for a
 * caller who holds that rule on the resource the request is made against.
 * <p>
 * The access rule of each screen is data, stated by the hosting {@code jnt:contentTemplate} in
 * {@code j:requiredPermissionNames}. This filter reads the rule from there, which matters more for this
 * component than for most: {@code jnt:manageRoles} is hosted by templates that live in OTHER modules, and
 * each declares a different permission.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code siteSettings} hosts the site roles screen and declares {@code siteAdminSiteRoles};</li>
 *   <li>{@code serverSettings} hosts the server roles screen and declares {@code adminServerRoles};</li>
 *   <li>{@code serverSettings} also hosts the system roles screen and declares {@code systemToolsAccess}
 *       (a core permission, so it resolves wherever Jahia runs).</li>
 * </ul>
 * A permission list held in this class would therefore have to name three permissions defined by two other
 * modules, and stay in step with them. Reading the requirement from whichever template hosts the render
 * removes that coupling, and keeps each screen's own granularity: a caller is served a screen when they hold
 * the permission that screen names, whether granted directly or through an ancestor permission that
 * aggregates it.
 * <p>
 * Two conditions, both required:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>the component renders from a module's template definitions
 *       ({@code /modules/<module>/<version>/templates/...}), which is where a settings screen is defined;</li>
 *   <li>the caller holds every permission the nearest declaring template ancestor requires.</li>
 * </ol>
 * A component whose ancestors declare no requirement, and a render with no resolvable context resource,
 * yield an empty fragment.
 * <p>
 * Which condition does the work. Core enforces the same requirement on the same context resource before
 * this filter runs: {@code TemplatePermissionCheckFilter} sits at priority 21 and restricts no node type.
 * On the administration route, condition 2 therefore agrees with core rather than adding to it. Condition 1
 * has no equivalent in core, because the gated node type carry no {@code jmix:requiredPermissions}
 * of their own and this module declares no view-level {@code requirePermissions}. Read this class as a
 * placement guard first.
 * <p>
 * Condition 2 still earns its place. Where the nearest declaring ancestor declares no requirement, core allows the render and this
 * filter refuses it. That matters more here than elsewhere, because the declaring templates live in other
 * modules, and a future host could add one without a requirement. It also does not depend on
 * core running first, so it still holds if the filter order changes.
 * <p>
 * The permissions are evaluated against the render's <strong>context resource</strong> — the main resource,
 * or the ajax resource for an ajax sub-render — and not against the component node. That is load-bearing
 * rather than incidental: the component node of a settings screen lives inside its module
 * ({@code /modules/...}), where a site-scoped administrator holds nothing, while the context resource is the
 * site or the global settings node that the administration route resolves, which is what the corresponding
 * role is granted on. Resolving it this way mirrors core's own evaluation of
 * {@code j:requiredPermissionNames} ({@code TemplatePermissionCheckFilter}), so a screen reached through
 * its administration route resolves identically here.
 * <p>
 * Because {@code WebflowAction} re-enters the render chain for each webflow POST, both conditions cover
 * every transition and not just the initial GET. In studio, template permissions stay core's business and
 * this filter applies the placement condition alone, matching how core evaluates
 * {@code j:requiredPermissionNames} there.
 * <p>
 * Registered via OSGi Declarative Services — see the wiring note above.
