/**
 * Renders a settings component only when the caller holds an administration permission on the resource the
 * request is actually made against.
 * <p>
 * The permission requirement belongs on the component, not only on the settings template that normally
 * hosts it ({@code j:requiredPermissionNames}): a component's access rule should travel with the component
 * and hold on every render path, regardless of where the component is placed. Because {@code WebflowAction}
 * re-enters the render chain for each webflow POST, it covers every transition too, not just the initial GET.
 * <p>
 * The check is evaluated against the <strong>main resource</strong> of the render, not against the component
 * node, and that is load-bearing rather than incidental: the component node of a <em>legitimate</em> settings
 * screen lives inside its module ({@code /modules/...}), where a site-scoped administrator holds nothing.
 * Checking the component node, which is the obvious implementation, would therefore refuse real site
 * administrators. The main resource is the site or the global settings node, which is what the corresponding
 * administrator role is actually granted on.
 * <p>
 * The accepted permissions are the COARSE core ones ({@code root-permissions.xml}); the finer per-screen
 * permissions come from a module's own {@code permissions.xml} and resolve to {@code false}
 * indistinguishably from a denial where they are not registered, which would fail closed for administrators
 * too. The finer requirement still applies on the administration route via the template, so this filter is
 * an additional condition and never a replacement. Failing to resolve a main resource yields an empty
 * fragment rather than a rendered component.
 * <p>
 * Registered via OSGi Declarative Services. On this line the parent predates automatic annotation scanning,
 * so {@code pom.xml} carries the {@code <_dsannotations>} bnd instruction; without it this class would ship
 * with no OSGI-INF descriptor and never register.
