 * Wiring note — this is deliberately OSGi Declarative Services, not a Spring bean.
 *
 * Jahia's engineering conventions (the shared `cortex` harness, skill
 * `jahia-java-osgi-declarative-services`) state the rule as: DS is the ONLY dependency-injection
 * mechanism allowed in a Jahia module — Blueprint is deprecated and Spring is forbidden, with the sole
 * tolerated exception being a guarded `SpringContextSingleton.getBean(...)` read-through to a core bean.
 * An earlier revision of this filter was registered as a Spring bean in META-INF/spring; it was moved
 * here to follow that rule, and the render filter it registers behaves identically either way (both end
 * up in JahiaTemplateManagerService.getRenderFilters()).
 *
 * The same harness documents the trap to watch for if this is ever ported to another module: without the
 * bnd instruction `<_dsannotations>*</_dsannotations>`, an @Component class compiles and ships but emits
 * no OSGI-INF descriptor and no Service-Component header, so the component silently never registers and
 * the gate below simply does not run. Parents `jahia-modules` >= 8.1.7.0 switch it on already; older ones
 * do not. Verify a descriptor is actually in the built jar rather than assuming.

/**
 * Renders a settings component only when the caller holds an administration permission on the resource the
 * request is actually made against.
 * <p>
 * The permission requirement belongs on the component, not only on the settings template that normally
 * hosts it ({@code j:requiredPermissionNames}): a component's access rule should travel with the component
 * and hold on every render path, regardless of where the component is placed. This filter makes the
 * requirement a property of the component so it applies uniformly. Because {@code WebflowAction} re-enters
 * the render chain for each webflow POST, it covers every transition too, not just the initial GET.
 * <p>
 * The check is evaluated against the <strong>main resource</strong> of the render, not against the component
 * node, and that is load-bearing rather than incidental: the component node of a <em>legitimate</em> settings
 * screen lives inside its module ({@code /modules/...}), where a site-scoped administrator holds nothing —
 * measured, {@code site-admin} is {@code false} there and {@code true} on {@code /sites/<key>}. Checking
 * the component node, which is the obvious implementation, would therefore refuse real site administrators.
 * The main resource is the site (site-settings route) or the global settings node (server-administration
 * route), which is what the corresponding administrator role is actually granted on.
 * <p>
 * Either {@code site-admin} or {@code admin} is accepted because {@code jnt:manageRoles} is hosted by both
 * administration routes: siteSettings registers it as {@code roleGroup="site-role"} under
 * {@code siteAdminSiteRoles}, serverSettings as server- and system-role. A site-scoped administrator is
 * therefore a legitimate caller. Both are core permissions ({@code root-permissions.xml}).
 * The finer per-screen requirement declared on the settings template remains enforced on the administration
 * route, so this filter is an additional condition and never a replacement. Failing to resolve a main resource
 * yields an empty fragment rather than a rendered component.
 * <p>
 * Registered via OSGi Declarative Services — no Spring context involvement.
