/**
 * Renders a settings component only when the caller holds an administration permission on the
 * resource the request is actually made against.
 * <p>
 * The role-management screen is an ordinary, instantiable content type, so the settings container it was
 * designed for is not the only place it can be rendered from. The permission requirement is declared on the
 * settings <em>template</em> that hosts it ({@code j:requiredPermissionNames}) and is therefore a property of
 * that template: the same component rendered through any other resource — a plain page content area — carries
 * no requirement at all, and the web flow behind it would be handed to whoever can render that resource. This
 * filter makes the requirement a property of the component, so it holds on every render path.
 * <p>
 * The check is evaluated against the <strong>main resource</strong> of the render, not against the component
 * node, and for this screen that is essential rather than incidental. {@code jnt:manageRoles} is hosted by
 * <em>both</em> administration routes — siteSettings registers it as {@code roleGroup="site-role"} under
 * {@code siteAdminSiteRoles}, serverSettings as server- and system-role — so a site-scoped administrator is a
 * legitimate caller. Their role is granted on {@code /sites/<key>}, while the component node of the
 * legitimate screen lives inside the hosting module ({@code /modules/...}), where they hold nothing. Checking
 * the component node would therefore refuse them; the main resource is the site (or the global settings node
 * for the server route), which is what each administrator role is actually granted on.
 * <p>
 * Either administration permission is accepted for the same reason. Both are core permissions
 * ({@code root-permissions.xml}) granted by the {@code site-administrator} / {@code server-administrator}
 * roles; the finer per-screen requirement remains enforced on the administration route by the template, so
 * this filter is an additional condition and never a replacement. Failing to resolve a main resource, or a
 * missing configuration, yields an empty fragment rather than a rendered component.
